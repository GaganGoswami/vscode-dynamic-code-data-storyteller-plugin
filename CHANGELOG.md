  - Memory-efficient circular buffer for state history

- **Call Graph Builder**: Dynamic call graph construction and visualization
  - Static analysis using Tree-sitter
  - Runtime enhancement through debug session data
  - Performance metrics collection (timing, frequency)
  - Interactive force-directed graph layout

- **What-If Engine**: Sandboxed scenario execution
  - VM2-based isolation for safe code execution
  - Mock input injection and testing
  - Execution path analysis and visualization
  - Performance impact assessment
  - Code coverage tracking

- **Side Effect Detector**: Comprehensive side effect monitoring
  - I/O operation detection (file, network, console)
  - Database transaction tracking
  - Memory modification alerts
  - Process interaction monitoring
  - Impact level classification (low, medium, high, critical)

#### User Interface
- **Tabbed Visualization Interface**:
  - Call Graph: Interactive node-link diagrams
  - Variable Trace: Timeline-based variable state visualization
  - What-If Analysis: Scenario configuration and results
  - Side Effects: Categorized effect monitoring
  - Timeline: Comprehensive event timeline

- **Interactive Controls**:
  - Play/pause animation controls
  - Speed adjustment (0.1x to 2x)
  - Timeline scrubbing and navigation
  - Filter and search functionality
  - Export options (JSON, CSV, SVG)

#### Language Support
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Full AST parsing and ES6+ support
- **Python**: Function/class detection and scope analysis
- **Java**: Class/method parsing and package structure analysis
- **C/C++**: Function/variable detection and memory operation tracking

#### Integration
- **VS Code Integration**:
  - Command palette integration
  - Context menu options
  - Debug session automatic attachment
  - Webview panel management
  - Theme-aware UI (light/dark/high-contrast)

- **Debug Adapter Protocol**:
  - Automatic debug session detection
  - Variable state monitoring
  - Stack trace analysis
  - Breakpoint integration

#### Configuration
- **Extension Settings**:
  - `storyteller.enableRealTimeTracking`: Toggle real-time tracking
  - `storyteller.maxTraceDepth`: Configure maximum trace depth
  - `storyteller.supportedLanguages`: Customize supported languages

### Technical Implementation

#### Architecture
- Modular component design with clear separation of concerns
- Observer pattern for debug session event handling
- Singleton pattern for webview panel management
- Command pattern for user action encapsulation

#### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of components and visualizations
- Debounced debug message processing
- Memory management with circular buffers
- Efficient data structures (Maps, Sets) for fast lookups

#### Security Features
- VM2 sandboxing for isolated code execution
- Content Security Policy for webview protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Timeout protection against infinite loops

#### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation on component failures
- Comprehensive error logging and diagnostics
- Recovery mechanisms for transient failures
- User-friendly error messages

### Dependencies
- **Core**: VS Code Extension API 1.74+
- **Parsing**: Tree-sitter and language-specific grammars
- **Sandbox**: VM2 for isolated execution
- **Visualization**: D3.js for interactive charts
- **Testing**: Mocha and VS Code Test Runner

### Known Issues
- Large codebases may experience slower analysis times
- What-if analysis limited to JavaScript/TypeScript initially
- Memory usage may increase with extensive variable tracking

### Development
- TypeScript-based implementation with strict type checking
- ESLint configuration for code quality
- Comprehensive test suite with unit and integration tests
- Documentation with usage guides and architecture overview

## [Unreleased]
